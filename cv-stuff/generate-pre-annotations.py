#ok this actually works looks like! but need to clean up local image studio stuff
#ie remove wrong images / extra ones,
# remove the images that just don't show any new data etc...
# then apply the label to the remains ones
# then like manually ensure those are correct labels
#THEN approve them and export the imgs to yolo format...
#start extracting value etc!!
